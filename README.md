# OsirisProject
This project is the biggest project I've ever attempted. Thanks for making it this far. I'm so thankful for everyone who followed me through this journey and made this project worth it :)

## Unraveling

Unraveling, the first movement, takes inspiration from both Unraveling by Andrew Boyson, Jr. and Paprikash by Julie Giroux. It begins the story of a person who wants to achieve their dreams. This movement is all about succeeding at your dream; at the cost of doing it the wrong way. It climaxes right before F, where the person’s repercussions finally begin piling up until they all come crashing down at the very end.

## On a Hymnsong

The second movement of the show, the ballad, takes its inspiration from On a Hymnsong of Phillip Bliss by David Holsinger. It’s about picking yourself up after a massive failure and reconciling with not only your happiness but your mental health.

## Shadow Rituals

Picking up straight after the events of On a Hymnsong, Shadow Rituals is about using the knowledge you gained in picking yourself back up to get yourself to the top the right way. However, you feel the need to get revenge on those who brought you down, so right before R, you attempt to do so; but quickly realize your wrongdoings, and do things the right way.

## Final Words

I'm so happy this project has come out to what it is. Without the support of everyone around me, I definitely wouldn't have been able to make it through this wild ride of writing this show. The order of this show is Unraveling, then you should listen to the On a Hymnsong with Shadow Rituals MP3. Its written to have the ballad flow straight into the closer; but if you dont want to listen to it this way and listen to the parts by themselves, you can do that too. Thanks again for all the support :) -Tyler
