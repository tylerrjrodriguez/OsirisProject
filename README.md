# OsirisProject
This project is the biggest project I've ever attempted. Thanks for making it this far.

## Unraveling

This movement is the opener. It's about the journey towards a dream, and what it takes to push towards the dream.

## On a Hymnsong

This movement is the ballad. It's all about picking yourself back up after a massive problem in your life, and reconciling with your own happiness and good mental health.

## Shadow Rituals

This movement is about self control, and forcing yourself to push yourself past the enemies you made getting to where you are.
