# OsirisProject
This project is the biggest project I've ever attempted. Thanks for making it this far. I'm so thankful for everyone who followed me through this journey and made this project worth it :)

## Unraveling

This movement is the opener. It's about the journey towards a dream, and what it takes to push towards the dream.

## On a Hymnsong

This movement is the ballad. It's all about picking yourself back up after a massive problem in your life, and reconciling with your own happiness and good mental health.

## Shadow Rituals

This movement is the closer. It's about self control, and forcing yourself to push yourself past the enemies you made getting to where you are.

## Final Words

I'm so happy this project has come out to what it is. Without the support of everyone around me, I definitely wouldn't have been able to make it through this wild ride of writing this show. The order of this show is Unraveling, then you should listen to the On a Hymnsong with Shadow Rituals MP3. Its written to have the ballad flow straight into the closer; but if you dont want to listen to it this way and listen to the parts by themselves, you can do that too. Thanks again for all the support :) -Tyler
